# Reaction_rate_in_neutron_star
Reaction_rate_in_neutron_star

This is the net rate: 
which is the rate for the process n —> p + e (+nu) 
minus the rate for the inverse process p + e —> n (+nu)
When there are too many neutrons, i.e. when mu l = mu n -mu p - mu e is positive, the provided rate is negative, causing neutrons to be lost in the neutron equation.
